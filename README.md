# üß© ProblemSolving ‚Äî Data Structures, Algorithms & Logic in C#/.NET

This repository is my dedicated space for practicing and solving problems related to **data structures**, **algorithms**, and general **problem solving** using **C#** and **.NET**. It includes solutions to problems from platforms like **LeetCode** and other random coding challenges covering various DSA topics and logical reasoning.

## üìö What‚Äôs Included

- Solutions to classic problems: arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, recursion, and more.
- Practice with different problem-solving techniques and optimizations.
- Well-organized C# code with clear structure and naming.
- Each problem is solved with a focus on readability and maintainability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Mr1Compiler/ProblemSolving.git
   cd ProblemSolving

2. Open the solution in your preferred IDE (Visual Studio, Rider, VS Code).

3. Build and run test cases to verify solutions.

## ‚úÖ Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to sharpen my problem-solving skills, improve my understanding of **data structures and algorithms**, and build strong logical thinking for technical interviews and real-world programming tasks.
